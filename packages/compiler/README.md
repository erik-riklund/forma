### Tiny compiler. Maximum power.

**Forma Compiler** is a ~2kB declarative, component-based JavaScript template compiler.  
It enables you to create highly efficient, secure, and maintainable server-rendered applications with ease.

Forma combines a minimal footprint with a robust feature set, ensuring your applications are both **lightweight and efficient**—a crucial advantage in modern web development. Designed with a clear focus on server-side rendering, Forma avoids client-side interactivity, making it a perfect fit for scenarios where simplicity and performance are paramount. For client-side interactivity, consider pairing Forma with tools like [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/), which seamlessly complement its capabilities.

- ⚙️ **Composable** — build your UI with simple, nested components  
- 🧩 **Component-oriented** — scoped props, children, slots  
- 🔒 **Secure by design** — no `eval`, no dynamic execution inside templates  
- 🚀 **Feature-rich** — everything you need, nothing you don’t

## 🧪 Examples

>This section is under construction. 🚧

### Using named slots

```html
<!-- main template -->
<component layout>
  <render slot="header"><h1>Welcome</h1></render>
  <p>Hello {{ user.name -> Guest }}</p>
</component>
```

```html
<!-- layout component -->
<header><slot header>No title</slot></header>
<main>{{@ children}}</main>
```

```ts
import { compile } from 'forma-compiler';

// we assume that `main` is the main template, and `layout` is the layout component
const compiledFunction = compile.toFunction(main, { layout });
const renderedHtml = compiledFunction({ user: { name: 'Forma' } });
```

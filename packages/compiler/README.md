### Tiny compiler. Maximum power.
> Please note that this project is in an early stage. Use with caution - there may be breaking changes ahead üòÉ

**Forma Compiler** is a ~2.5kB declarative, component-based template compiler.  
It enables you to create highly efficient, secure, and maintainable server-rendered applications with ease.

Forma combines a minimal footprint with a robust feature set, ensuring your applications are both **lightweight and efficient**‚Äîa crucial advantage in modern web development. Designed with a clear focus on server-side rendering, Forma avoids client-side interactivity, making it a perfect fit for scenarios where simplicity and performance are paramount. For client-side interactivity, consider pairing Forma with tools like [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/), which seamlessly complement its capabilities.

## üöß Roadmap

- ‚úîÔ∏è Components with block content
- ‚úîÔ∏è Named slots with default content
- ‚úîÔ∏è List rendering (including reverse mode)
- ‚úîÔ∏è Variables with default values and safe lookups
- ‚úîÔ∏è HTML-encoded variables to avoid script injections (with a modifier to allow raw content)
- ‚úîÔ∏è Simple conditional rendering
- üöß Self-closing element for components without block content
- ü§∑ Template syntax scan to catch errors like missing end tags before compilation?
- ü§∑ Extendable and customizable template syntax?

## üßê How it works

The compiler takes your template code and transforms it into JavaScript render functions. These functions directly output the final HTML, without relying on a virtual DOM or runtime template parsing. This approach ensures minimal overhead and maximum performance, making Forma an excellent choice for server-side rendering.

### A very basic template

Let's assume that we have the following template:

```html
<h1>Hello world</h1>
```

After being compiled, it's transformed to this:

```js
(self, parent) => {
  self = self || {};
  parent = parent || {};
  self.__slots = [];
  var v = (t) => (typeof t === 'function' ? t() : t);
  var e = (t) => t.replaceAll('<', '&lt;').replaceAll('>', '&gt;');
  var c = (t) => t !== false && t !== null && t !== undefined;
  if (self.__slots.length) {
    self.__children && self.__children();
  }
  return `<h1>Hello world</h1>`;
};
```

### An example using a component

Let's assume that we have these templates:

```js
const component = '<h1>News</h1>{{@ children}}';
const template = '<component test>Forma is taking shape!</component>';

const renderFunction = compile.toString(template, { test: component });
```

After being compiled, it's transformed to this:

```js
(self, parent) => {
  self = self || {};
  parent = parent || {};
  self.__slots = [];
  
  var v = (t) => (typeof t === 'function' ? t() : t);
  var e = (t) => t.replaceAll('<', '&lt;').replaceAll('>', '&gt;');
  var c = (t) => t !== false && t !== null && t !== undefined;

  var __test = (self, parent) => {
    self = self || {};
    parent = parent || {};
    self.__slots = [];
    
    var v = (t) => (typeof t === 'function' ? t() : t);
    var e = (t) => t.replaceAll('<', '&lt;').replaceAll('>', '&gt;');
    var c = (t) => t !== false && t !== null && t !== undefined;

    if (self.__slots.length) {
      self.__children && self.__children();
    }
    return `<h1>News</h1>${v(self.__children) || ''}`;
  };

  if (self.__slots.length) {
    self.__children && self.__children();
  }
  return `${__test({ __children: () => `Forma is taking shape!` }, self)}`;
};
```

When the function is executed, the resulting output is `<h1>News</h1>Forma is taking shape!`.

## üì¶ Installation

To install Forma Compile, use your preferred `npm`-compatible package manager:

```bash
npm install forma-compile
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Using the compiler

After installing Forma Compile, you can start using its compiler by importing it into your project:

```js
import { compile } from 'forma-compile';
```

The `compile` API provides two key methods: `toFunction` and `toString`.

### `toFunction`

This method compiles a template into a reusable render function:

```js
const template = 'Hello {{ name }}!';
const renderFunction = compile.toFunction(template);

// Execute the render function with a data context
const output = renderFunction({ name: 'World' });
console.log(output); // Output: Hello World!
```

### `toString`

This method compiles a template into a string representation of the render function, which can be cached or reused:

```js
const template = 'Hello {{ name }}!';
const compiledFunction = compile.toString(template);

console.log(compiledFunction); // Output: A string representation of the render function
```

### Parameters

Both methods share the same parameters:

- **`template: Template`**: The template string to be compiled.
- **`dependencies: Dependencies = {}`**: An optional object containing components that the template rely on.
- **`{ recursive }: Options = {}`**: An optional configuration object. The `recursive` flag determines whether the compiler should enable the component to call itself.


### When to use each method

- **`toFunction`**: Use this for immediate execution of templates with a data context.
- **`toString`**: Use this for scenarios where you need to store or transmit the compiled function, such as caching or server-side precompilation.

## üìñ Learning the syntax

Forma templates use a concise, declarative syntax designed for simplicity and developer experience. The syntax is intentionally minimalistic, allowing you to focus on the structure and logic of your templates without unnecessary complexity.

### Key syntax features

1. **Declarative** ‚Äî Forma templates emphasize a declarative approach, where you describe what the UI should look like rather than how to construct it. This makes the templates easier to read and maintain.

2. **Minimal boilerplate** ‚Äî With Forma, you can achieve more with less code. The syntax avoids unnecessary verbosity, enabling you to write clean and efficient templates.

3. **Safe and predictable** ‚Äî Built-in safeguards like HTML encoding for variables ensure that your templates are secure by default, reducing the risk of common vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting (XSS).

4. **Component-centric** ‚Äî The syntax is optimized for building reusable components, making it easy to create modular and maintainable UIs.

5. **Flexible modifiers** ‚Äî Forma provides powerful modifiers like `!` for raw content and `:` for locally scoped variables, giving you fine-grained control over your templates.

6. **Built-in control flow** ‚Äî With native support for conditionals, loops, and slots, Forma templates can handle complex rendering logic without relying on external libraries or frameworks.

By combining these features, Forma templates strike a balance between simplicity and power, making them an excellent choice for developers looking to build scalable and maintainable server-side rendered applications.

### üß† Variables

Forma templates support variable interpolation with optional default values. By default, these variables point to the provided data context. You can use the `:` modifier to access variables from the current scope. This is especially useful inside lists or when passing properties between components.

```html
<!--
Compiles to `self.name` (the provided data context)
-->
Hello {{ name }}

<!--
Compiles to `self.user?.name` OR "Guest"
-->
Hello {{ user.name -> Guest }} 

<!--
Compiles to `name` (a local variable, e.g. rendering a list)
-->
Hello {{: name }}
```

Variables are **HTML-encoded** for safety. You can disable this by using the `!` modifier:

```html
<!--
Compiles to `self.content` (the provided data context)
-->
{{! content }}

<!--
Compiles to `content` (a local variable)
-->
{{!: content }}
```

> *You can combine `!` and `:` as long as the exclamation mark comes first.*

---

### üß© Components

Components are isolated templates that receive **properties** and **block content**:

```html
<!-- component without block content -->
<component button label="Click me"></component>

<!-- self-closing component without block content -->
<component button label="Click me" />

<!-- component with block content -->
<component button>Click me</component>
```

#### Implicit property names

Forma allows you to define properties implicitly using the `~` prefix. This is useful for scenarios where the property name matches the variable name, reducing redundancy in your templates.

```html
<component user name="{ name }">Hello world</component>
```

The above example explicitly sets the `name` property to the value of the `name` variable. With implicit property names, you can simplify this:

```html
<component user ~name>Hello world</component>
```

Here, the `~name` shorthand automatically assigns the value of the `name` variable to the `name` property. This makes your templates cleaner and easier to read, especially when dealing with multiple properties.

> If there is both a local variable `name` and a context variable, the local variable takes precedence.

#### Passing dynamic property values

You can pass variable values using `{...}` (single braces), and the `:` modifier can be used for local variables. These variables are **never** HTML-encoded; they are passed as raw values.

```html
<component card title="{ user.name }"></component>
```

#### Using properties and rendering block content

Inside the component template, use `{{ label }}` or `{{@ children }}` to reference properties or the provided block content:

```html
<!-- button component -->
<button>{{ label }}</button>

<!-- layout component -->
<header>Header</header>
<main>{{@ children}}</main>
<footer>Footer</footer>
```

---

### üîå Named slots

You can define **named slot content** using `<render slot="name">` and consume it using `<slot name>` in a component:

```html
<!-- template -->
<component layout>
  <render slot="title">
    <h1>My Page</h1>
  </render>
  <p>Welcome to Forma!</p>
</component>
```

```html
<!-- layout component -->
<header>
  <slot title>No title available</slot>
</header>
<main>{{@ children }}</main>
```

> If a slot isn't rendered, the fallback content inside `<slot>` will be used instead.

---

### üîÅ Rendering lists

Forma includes built-in iteration via `<list>` and `<reverse-list>`:

```html
<list users as="user">
  <li>{{: user.name }}</li>
</list>

<reverse-list items as="item">
  <p>{{: item }}</p>
</reverse-list>
```

All items are automatically scoped as the variable you define (e.g. `user`, `item`).

---

### üîÄ Conditional rendering

Forma supports inline control flow with `<if>`, `<else-if>`, and `<else>`:

```html
<if condition="loggedIn">Welcome back!</if>
<if not condition="loggedIn">Please log in.</if>

<if condition="a">
  A is true
<else-if condition="b">
  B is true
<else>
  Neither is true...
</if>
```

Conditions default to `self.variableName`, but you can use local scoping with `:`:

```html
<if condition=": someLocalVariable">...</if>
```

---

### üîÄ Switch-like conditional rendering

Switch-like conditional rendering evaluates a value against multiple cases, much like a traditional switch statement. This helps keep your templates clean and efficient, as the compiler optimizes these constructs into minimal render functions.

```html
<when variable="status">
  <case is="loading">Loading...</case>
  <case is="error">Something went wrong.</case>
  <default>Unknown status</default>
</when>
```

By default, the specified variable points to `self.variableName`, which is the provided data context. Adding a `:` before the variable name points it to a local variable instead.

## üßê How it works

The compiler takes your template code and transforms it into JavaScript render functions. These functions utilize [template literals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals) to generate HTML strings directly ‚Äî no virtual DOM, no runtime template parsing. This approach ensures minimal overhead and maximum performance, making Forma an excellent choice for server-side rendering.

### A very basic template

Let's assume that we have the following template:

```html
Hello world
```

After being compiled, it's transformed to a render function that is safe to cache and reuse in any server-rendered context. 

> It is most likely safe to use in browsers as well, but this isn't actively tested as it's outside the project's scope. üîç

```js
(self, parent) => {
  self = self || {};
  parent = parent || {};
  self.__slots = [];

  const v = (t) => typeof t === 'function' ? t() : t;
  const e = (t) => typeof t === 'string' && t.replaceAll('<','&lt;').replaceAll('>','&gt;') || t;
  const r = (t) => t !== false && t !== null && t !== undefined;
  const c = (a,b) => typeof a=== 'number' ? a === parseInt(b) : a === b;
  
  if (self.__children) {
    self.__children_r = self.__children();
  }
  return `Hello world`;
};
```

The helper functions (`v`, `e`, `r`, and `c`) are injected into every compiled template:
- `v`: safely resolves function values
- `e`: encodes HTML
- `r`: evaluates truthiness
- `c`: compares switch values

They are always present, even when not used, as each template is self-contained.

> When the cache handler is introduced into the Forma suite, it will employ optimizations that remove unused helpers and components. The compiler doesn't care. üòÑ

# Forma

### Build with structure, render with purpose. üöÄ  
> _Please note that this project is a work in progress_ üòÉ

**Forma** is a ~3.5kB declarative template compiler ‚Äî and the foundation of a focused suite of tools for building server-rendered applications.

At its core, Forma transforms clean, HTML-like templates into pure JavaScript render functions with no runtime parsing or client-side dependencies. It's designed for developers who want to build applications using templates with **less logic** and **more intent**.

---

## üîß Overview

The Forma suite is designed to be modular and purpose-driven, with each tool focusing on a specific responsibility within the server-rendered workflow. This approach ensures that you can pick and choose the components you need, enabling a streamlined and efficient development process without unnecessary overhead.
